# LIA Notebook

In this file you should note every action that you take during your LIA-process. Please follow the rules below, as your teacher will scan all files periodically to monitor the progress of the class.

## Rules

1. Only make notes in the table.
2. One row per action. Copy the last row and fill out info between the pipes. (||||||)
3. All fields except "comments" are mandatory.
4. Actions can only be one of the following:
    - Mailed/called
    - Visited
    - Interviewed
    - Test completed
    - Recieved rejection
    - Recieved offer
    - Contract signed
    - Other (use sparingly and with comments field filled.)
5. The pre-written row in the table is an example. Replace it when you write your first note.
